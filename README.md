# Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model on a noisy quantum computer

In this repository you can find the code used to produce some plots in https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17991.
The notebook for N=6 can be run on IBM devices by reading the QASM files for time evolution. 
The script to generate different realisation of the SYK model is also provided.
